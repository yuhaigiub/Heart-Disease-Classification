# Heart-Disease-Classification


To get the dataset to this project, go to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease


This project is a simple machine learning project to predict the HeartDisease base on a given dataset. The most notable property of this dataset is that it is imbalance
(i.e. The number of sample without Heart disease is very large compare to sample with Heart disease), so measures have to be taken to deal with this problem, 
or the result of your algorithm may be affected a lot.
